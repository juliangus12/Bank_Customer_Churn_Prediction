# Comparing Different Forms of Regression and Neural Networks to Predict Bank Customer Churn

## Participants:

## Project Summary:
This project is part of the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series, aimed at predicting whether a bank customer will churn (i.e., close their account) or continue using their bank services. The data set used in this project comes from ABC Multistate Bank and contains various features about the customers, such as their credit score, age, gender, number of products, and whether they are an active member of the bank. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the customer churned or not.

Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of different regression techniques (Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Logistic, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and a neural network model optimized with Adam on predicting customer churn. We employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of these models and compared them based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
